# Source-Code-Scanner---Coupons-Discount-Codes
Input a websites URL, will scan source code for possible coupon/discount codes possibly left behind by the web devs

Requirements:

Python Installed

Requests 

Steps To Use (Just in Case :))
1. Save the code
2. Open terminal/command prompt
3. Run the script
a. use: python find_coupon_codes.py
b. or (if your system uses python 3): python find_coupon_codes.py
4. Enter URL
5. Results!

Good luck (just in case a dev somehow did leave these in the source code (although unlikely)) 

WARNING: 
If the code finds possible coupons and they do not look like "normal" coupon codes, etc, it is very likely not actually coupon codes and the program mistook it for coupon codes.
